Generate a compelling, engaging script for a 60-second video.

STYLE: {style}
{style_instructions.get(style, 'Create an engaging video.')}

CRITICAL STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate EXACTLY 10 slides, no more, no less
- Each slide should be approximately 6 seconds long (adjust slightly if needed, but total must be close to 60 seconds)
- Total duration across all 10 slides must sum to 58-62 seconds
- Each slide must have these three components:
  1. narration: The exact spoken text for this slide (conversational, natural, flows well when spoken aloud)
  2. image_prompt: A highly detailed, visual description for AI image generation (be specific about composition, style, mood, colors, subjects)
  3. duration: Time in seconds (typically 5.5-6.5 seconds per slide)

IMAGE PROMPT GUIDELINES:
- Be extremely specific and descriptive (include: subject, setting, lighting, mood, composition, art style)
- Good example: "A cozy coffee shop interior at sunrise, warm golden light streaming through large windows, a steaming latte on a wooden table in the foreground, soft bokeh background with blurred customers, cinematic photography style, warm color palette"
- Bad example: "A coffee shop"
- Avoid text in images - describe visual scenes only
- Each image should be distinct and visually interesting
- Images should match and enhance the narration

NARRATION GUIDELINES:
- Write as if speaking directly to the viewer
- Use short, punchy sentences that are easy to understand when heard
- Make it conversational and engaging, not robotic
- Each narration should naturally flow into the next
- Total word count across all narrations should be around 150-180 words (comfortable speaking pace)
